      <h2>Austin Williams</h2>
      <h3>Future Coder</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Austin Williams and I am a coder-in-training. I am currently enrolled in the September full-time software development program. Based on my experience with coding so far I find it to be both fun and excitingly challenging. Though I do not <i>(yet)</i> have professional training, what I do have is commitment and an eagerness to learn! I am very excited for the upcoming course as well as my future career as a developer.</p>
      
      <p><i>"But Austin, you haven't yet addressed the elephant in the room."</i></p>
      
      <p>Fair enough, I am a 29-year old man who loves Batman <i>(and Legos)</i> hence the overall theme of this website. While I admire the Dark Knightâ€™s mission in vigilantism, I realize that I am neither a billionaire nor a martial-arts expert. Given these harsh realizations I think a career in software development is a better fit for me. Also, I worry that talking in that deep <i>"Batman voice"</i> for too long could do some permanent damage to my voice box. Instead, I will spend my days defeating bugs, catching errors, and saving damsels in distress! Okay, maybe not that last one, but the important thing to remember is that not all heroes wear capes.</p>
      
      <p>Cheers, and happy coding to all!</p>
